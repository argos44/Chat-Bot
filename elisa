Elisa was an Oscar Wilde (if I correctly remember) character, who always repeated the last words of a conversation.

The Chinese room argument of Searle proposes, that you have to have at least one concept (like apple) anchored down into sensorimotor invariance. 

Meaning, that you explore the object with your hands, vision, etc.

Then you can attach a semantic label to it (Harnad).

One you have some labels grounded in perception, then you can start to combine them.
